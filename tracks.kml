        <td>From the Karapoti Road car park, head along a gentle path up the valley.
<br /><br />
You'll soon need to cross the unbridged Little Akatarawa River.  It is rocky, cold, and can also be deep and fast flowing after heavy rain, so probably best avoided if there has been a lot of rain in the previous couple of days.
<br /><br />
Once past the river crossing the track meanders up the valley, climbing progressively alongside the Akatarawa River West.  The valley itself is deep, surrounded by steep hillsides covered with dense native bush.
<br /><br />
The track surface is rocky in places, though nothing too difficult.  During and immediately after heavy rain, parts of the track can have a fair amount of water flowing down/across them, which can make things interesting.
<br /><br />
At the top of this track is <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/192">McGhies</a>, which starts at an obvious concrete bridge.</td>

        <td><a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/193">Valley View Road</a> is one of the several official entrances to the <a href="/area/show/15">Akatarawa Forest</a> - though it is unclear if the entrance is currently open (see the note below). In any case, several other tracks lead to <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/193">Valley View Road</a>, including <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/198">Cannon Point Road</a>, <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/199">Cannon Point Walkway</a>, and <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/192">McGhies</a>.
<br /><br />
The initial climb up from Totara Park is quite steep.  From there, the road traverses a narrow ridge that connects Cannon Point with the northern (and larger) part of the Valley View Forest Block. There the road heads northeast along another ridge.
<br /><br />
At a T-intersection with <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/195">Lindsay's Road</a> (which continues straight ahead), the road turns left and drops down a steep section to end in a large clearing where it meets <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/192">McGhies</a> and the bottom of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/194">Woolshed Road</a>.
<br /><br />
There are several singletracks and small access track branching off <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/193">Valley View Road</a>. However, the Valley View Forest Block is reaching maturity and is progressively being cleared. Therefore, those tracks are unlikely to survive much longer.</td>

<br /><br />
Ends at a three-way intersection with <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/192">McGhies</a> and <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/194">Woolshed Road</a>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Other notes</td>
        <td>At the Totara Park Road entrance there is a sign that says "Authorised entry only. Logging trucks operating during daylight hours". Certainly there are logging trucks operating, since parts of the Valley View Forest are being logged during 2008 and 2009. However, it is not clear that the entrance is actually closed, since there do not appear to be similar signs on the other connecting tracks that are closer to the actual logging areas.

        <td>After a hard climb to reach the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/193">Valley View Road</a> ridge, this neat piece of clay road provides a fun reward. The descent is steep and fast, with a bit of rutted cornering to add some technical challenge.
<br /><br />
Towards the bottom of the hill there is a mud puddle that appears to be permanent.  After prolonged rain, the mud can be rather deep, so best to go around.
<br /><br />
It is possible to gather a fair bit of speed going down the straights, but beware that the clay surface offers little in the way of grip other than a thin layer of pine needles.</td>

You'll have to find you own way up the last 0.1-0.2km to the summit, as the track isn't well defined. The summit of Battle Hill provides nice views over Transmission Gully and the surrounding hills.

From the summit, drop back down to the track then along a ridge that drops quite steeply towards the farm buildings.

At the bottom of the hill, either follow the track around to the right, through the bush and onto a gravel road, or go directly across Abbott's Field to the farm buildings and car park.</td>

        <td>This track is completely different to the others in the <a href="/area/show/13">Battle Hill</a> Farm Forest Park.  It follows a steep 4x4 road through the forest, climbing almost 400m then dropping back down to where it started.
<br /><br />
At the top of the road there is a sign-post pointing up towards the right.  Climb up the track to almost the summit, then drop down towards the right along a narrow ridge which eventually drops down to meet a double track that returns to the end of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/137">Transmission Gully</a>.
<br /><br />
Alternatively, from the vicinity of the summit, there are several forrestry roads that continue deeper into the <a href="/area/show/15">Akatarawa Forest</a> for the more adventurous.</td>

<br /><br />
The loop ends 20 metres from where it starts, so return to the car park via <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/137">Transmission Gully</a>.</td>

        <td>This track follows a creek up the Horokiwi Valley to the clearing known as Baked Beans Bend. There isn't a lot of flow to this track, given its technical sections and many creek crossings.
<br /><br />
Depending on how they are counted, there are about nine unbridged creek crossings on this short track, some of which are only a few metres apart.  Provided that the water level is low, it is possible to ride or use stepping stones across the creek crossings without getting wet feet - but don't count on it.  One of the crossings is via a log which has been shaved to provide a flat top, which is rather tricky if carrying a bike.</td>

<br /><br />
There is a 200m altitude difference between the ends of this track.  Parts of the track are quite steep, with a grade of up to 12%, though the overall grade is much less.
<br /><br />
For most of its length the track surface is gravel and hard-packed clay, with the occasional grassy section.</td>

        <td>For the northern end, turn off State Highway 58 (Haywards Hill Road) and go up Belmont Road to where the seal ends. This is a narrow road - barely one lane - so watch out for traffic in the other direction. <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/134">Belmont Road</a> continues up the hill in the form of a farm road.
<br /><br />
The southern end of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/134">Belmont Road</a> is at an intersection with <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/107">Hill Road</a> and <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/158">Duck Creek</a>, by the gas station.</td>

        <td>Belmont Trig provides spectacular views over the <a href="/area/show/11">Belmont Regional Park</a> and beyond, including the South Island on a good day.  The climb is hard work, but the views are worthwhile.
<br /><br />
The track is a steep gravel road which forms part of a loop that includes <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/152">Dress Circle</a>, <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/112">Round Knob</a>, and <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/111">OCR Belmont</a>.
<br /><br />
Exit options include a fast descent down the same way to Stratton Street, or one of the adjoining tracks such as <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/151">Belmont Trig South</a> or <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/152">Dress Circle</a>. There is also an extremely steep shortcut that runs almost straight down the hill from the trig to the road.</td>

        <td>Getting there</td>
        <td>Go through the gate next to the cattle stop on Stratton Street.  Cross the small bridge, then look to the left, where there is a 4x4 road up the hill - that's it.  The start is very steep, but the rest isn't quite so bad.</td>

        <td>Description</td>
        <td>This is a difficult track that winds its way along a ridge to the south of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/100">Belmont Trig</a>.  The surface mostly consists of either smooth clay or rough rocks except for a pleasant, though short, forest section.
<br /><br />
The most common approach to this track is to start from the summit of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/100">Belmont Trig</a>.  From there, the track quickly drops 390m in altitude down to the floor of Horokiwi Valley.
<br /><br />
Like many hills in the area, this one gets progressively steeper as it approaches the valley.  In this case, that means an average grade of 15% for the upper sections and more like 25% for the lower sections.  Consequently, with a rough rock and clay surface, the last 0.4km section just above <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/150">Baked Beans Bend</a> is either a challenging descent or a demanding climb depending on which way you're going.
<br /><br /><a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/151">Belmont Trig South</a> is most commonly used as part of a loop that may include <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/100">Belmont Trig</a> or <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/152">Dress Circle</a>, leading to an exit from the <a href="/area/show/11">Belmont Regional Park</a>  via <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/150">Baked Beans Bend</a> and <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/99">Korokoro</a>.

        <td>From the summit of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/100">Belmont Trig</a>, go through the wooden gate 20m south of the trig marker.
<br /><br />
At the base of the hill, the track meets <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/150">Baked Beans Bend</a> and <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/149">Horokiwi Valley</a>.</td>

<br /><br />
The surface consists mostly of smooth clay and tangled tree roots, with only pine needles for grip.  There are several very steep clay slides, tight corners, and undulations.
<br /><br />
All up, this is a challenging track that makes an interesting alternative to <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/105">Danzig</a>.</td>

        <td>A 400m climb from the floor of the Hutt Valley to the summit of Boulder Hill.  Parts of the track are steep, especially towards the summit, though there is a flatish section in the middle.
<br /><br />
There is plenty of variety in terms of track surface – ranging from a well-formed gravel road on the lower sections, through to a grassy 4x4 track in the middle, and ending with a barely defined single track for the final section to the summit.
<br /><br />
The summit of Boulder Hill is littered with exposed boulders – hence the name.  A heap of small rocks have been collected to mark the summit with a sizable cairn.</td>

<br /><br />
When descending watch out for the zig-zag track that drops down to the car park.  If you reach a metal gate across the 4x4 road, then you’ve gone 30m too far.</td>

Conversely, the southern half of the track is a gentle meander along the valley floor to the base of the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/100">Belmont Trig</a> track.
<br /><br />
Although the northern section is mostly a descent, there are a couple of steep up hill sections to provide a bit of variety.
<br /><br />
In some parts of the southern section the track is not well defined, being more open field than track as such.  A couple of the creek crossings are not bridged, so can have quite deep mud at times.

There is then a short, sharp climb to a grassy clearing.  The track continues down to the right, crossing a walk bridge over Cannons Creek before again climbing steeply for almost 0.6km to a gate.  Climb over the stile, then head left and follow the track to the end of Takapu Road.
<br /><br />
From the end of Takapu Road, you can make your way further into the <a href="/area/show/11">Belmont Regional Park</a> - eventually making a traverse from Porirua to Petone, if you're really keen.</td>

<br /><br />
Alternatively, the top of the track is at the end of Takapu Road, just north of the substation, at the western end of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/158">Duck Creek</a>.</td>

<br /><br />
From the intersection with <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/152">Dress Circle</a>, the first section is a gentle cruise along a grassy farm track.  After abruptly dropping down a very steep (28%) grassy slope to a gate, the track continues down the hill along a sheep track before opening out to a rocky farm road under the transmission lines.  This road will take you down to an intersection, where you have a choice of continuing towards Porirua along <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/158">Duck Creek</a> or <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/156">Maara Roa</a>.</td>

<br /><br />
The track surface is mostly bare clay slides, with a few tree roots thrown in for variety.
<br /><br />
In dry conditions there is sufficient grip, plus handy berms on key corners, to give this track a nice flow.  But combine the steep clay slides with a bit of moisture and this would become a very challenging track in the wet.</td>

        <td>A great piece of classic single track which winds its way through a block of mature forest on a steep hillside.
<br /><br />
Danzig provides a good way to ascend to the Park's hilltop tracks - such as <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/111">OCR Belmont</a>, <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/112">Round Knob</a>, <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/152">Dress Circle</a>, and <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/100">Belmont Trig</a> - as part of a circuit that starts and ends at Stratton Street.
<br /><br />
The track surface is a combination of soft clay, tree roots, and pine needles, with a few rocks thrown in for variety. By the end of winter the track surface is usually deeply rutted, especially on the switchbacks.  By that stage, climbing is difficult and descending quickly is technically challenging.
<br /><br />
Half way along the track is a green hut, which also marks the start of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/142">Big Weta</a>.</td>

        <td>The bottom of the track is 250m past the Ranger Station at the end of Stratton Road, past some farm buildings and 50m beyond the gate.
<br /><br />
The top of the track is 1.5 km along <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/111">OCR Belmont</a>, measured from the end of Normandale Road - or less than 100m past the entry to <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/114">Sweetacres</a>.</td>

        <td>This track more-or-less traverses the ridgeline all the way from <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/112">Round Knob</a> through to <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/100">Belmont Trig</a>, summiting several hills including Cannons Head.
<br /><br />
Although there are no big climbs or descents on this track, there is a series of small hills.  When travelling from north to south the cumulative altitude gain is about 200m - even though the two track ends differ in altitude by less than 40m.
<br /><br />
Most of the track surface consists of hard-packed dirt and rock, with a fair amount of grass covering in many places.
<br /><br />
There are several exits from this track.  At the northern end is <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/112">Round Knob</a>.  At or near the southern end is: <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/100">Belmont Trig</a>, <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/151">Belmont Trig South</a>, and <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/148">Horokiwi Bridleway</a>.  Along the way you could also take: <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/157">Cannons Head</a>, <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/143">Middle Ridge</a>, or <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/115">Takapu Ridge</a>.</td>

        <td>This track is divided into six distinct stages, travelling clockwise from the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/101">Boulder Hill</a> end:
<br />
1. Gentle single track meanders through bush and open country.
<br />
2. A change in character sees the track get narrower, more technical, and steeper - abruptly dropping almost 100m to a small bridge over Dry Creek.
<br />
3. Steep climb to meet a 4x4 farm road, which is about 2.0km from <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/101">Boulder Hill</a>.
<br />
4. The 4x4 road continues climbing up Haywards Hill (though not to the summit).
<br />
5. From the highest point, the 4x4 road drops 250m down to the valley floor.  Beware that the last 0.5km is particularly brake-sizzling - and watch out for ruts and loose gravel.
<br />
6. Finally, there is a gentle path on which to unwind as you cruise back to the car park.</td>

Continue down and then up the gravel road until you encounter a small stand of trees at an intersection with <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/156">Maara Roa</a> and <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/157">Cannons Head</a>.  There is a sign on the left indicating that bikes may proceed no further, so if you're on a bike then either return the same way or head up one of the ajoining tracks.
<br /><br />
Otherwise, continue down the hill then turn up the main farm road to the airstrip - which marks the end of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/111">OCR Belmont</a>.

Continue along the road to just past the gas station where there is a major intersection with <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/134">Belmont Road</a> and <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/107">Hill Road</a>. Bikes are permitted on this final section from the airstrip.</td>

        <td>From the gap in the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/113">Stratton</a> treeline fence, it is only a short distance to the green hut where this track ends - hence the name.
<br /><br />
Halfway along there is a culvert over a small creek. Just before reaching the green hut this track crosses <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/116">The Slide</a>, so watch out for people coming down the hill.  At this intersection there is an official looking, though not particularly helpful, sign that simply says "Track". 
<br /><br />
Unlike other tracks in the forest block, which generally go up/down the hill, <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/154">Green Hut</a> cuts across the hill.  This creates opportunties for loops that intersect at the Green Hut, for example: climb <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/105">Danzig</a>, head north along a short section of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/111">OCR Belmont</a>, drop down <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/153">Choppers</a>, take <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/154">Green Hut</a> to the centre of the forest, then down <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/142">Big Weta</a> to near the bottom of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/105">Danzig</a>.</td>

The shortcut is useful in either direction, avoiding the less direct route via the airstrip and the top of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/158">Duck Creek</a>.

The track has a 5% grade and an only slightly bumpy grass and rock surface, so there is nothing too challenging.

It is useful because it provides additional options for loops within the <a href="/area/show/11">Belmont Regional Park</a>.
<br /><br />
Most of the track is across open paddock or grassy farm road.  On the way down towards <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/107">Hill Road</a>, watch out for an abrupt change in direction part way down the hill - go around to the left on a flatish road instead of continuing down the steep hill to the trees.
<br /><br />
Easiest if starting from the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/111">OCR Belmont</a> end, due to the quite steep 110m drop in altitude across the paddocks.</td>

        <td>Description</td>
        <td>This track was constructed in late 2008 to provide the Ranger and contractors with quad bike access to the Horokiwi valley by avoiding the steepest parts of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/148">Horokiwi Bridleway</a>.  It is a two-way track so expect traffic in either direction - though ascending cyclists are likely to be walking.
<br /><br />
Like other tracks in this part of <a href="/area/show/11">Belmont Regional Park</a>, this track is very steep.  The total altitude change is 330m, with a typical grade of 15%-20%, a couple of short uphill bits, and an especially steep final section at the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/148">Horokiwi Bridleway</a> end that has a grade approaching 30%.
<br /><br />
Much of the upper section coincides with <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/148">Horokiwi Bridleway</a>.  The two tracks have separate entrances and they diverge along different ridges about half way down the hill.</td>

    <tr>
        <td>Getting there</td>
        <td>About 50m north from the intersection of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/100">Belmont Trig</a> and <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/152">Dress Circle</a>, just below the summit of the trig, there is a grassy track heading north over a low ridge.  This track continues under the transmission line, through a gate marked with a "Private property" sign. Forty metres before getting to that gate, veer left (west) towards the treeline and through another gate that is at the bottom of a small gully.  Thereafter the track is clearly defined.
<br /><br />
The track ends when it meets <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/149">Horokiwi Valley</a>, around 0.5km north of the intersection of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/151">Belmont Trig South</a> and <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/150">Baked Beans Bend</a>.</td>

        <td>Description</td>
        <td>This is a track of two halves.  From Horokiwi Road, the western half drops down a steep 4x4 track to the floor of Horokiwi Valley.  The eastern half is an extremely steep climb to near the summit of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/100">Belmont Trig</a> (though probably best done as a challenging descent).
<br /><br />
In terms of track surface, the halves are also quite different.  The western half used to be narrow almost to the point of resembling singletrack, but has been opened up to be more of a 4x4 track. Substantial realignment work was done in late 2008 to bypass the steepest parts.  Apart from a short bush section at the top, the eastern half is either rocky singletrack or concealed by long grass.
<br /><br />
Beware of the extremely steep grassy sections on the eastern half.  The average slope down that part of the track is in excess of 30%, with some sections being even steeper.  The surface under the long grass is uneven with hidden holes, bumps, and rocks.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Getting there</td>
        <td>The western end drops off the side of Horokiwi Road about 0.2km before it turns around under the transmission line. The top of the track is clearly sign posted, about 0.2km along the unsealed part of Horokiwi Road.
<br /><br />
The eastern end of this track meets <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/100">Belmont Trig</a> just below the summit, about 50m south-west of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/152">Dress Circle</a>'s southern end.</td>

        <td>About 40% of the eastern half coincides with <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/190">Honeysuckle Ridge</a> track, which was constructed to bypass the steepest parts of this track.
<br /><br />
This track finally deviates from <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/190">Honeysuckle Ridge</a> at an S-bend in <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/190">Honeysuckle Ridge</a> just after it has passed through the fence a few times.  <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/148">Horokiwi Bridleway</a> continues as a barely discernable track down a ridge towards a grassy knoll that has an orange track marker on it.  <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/190">Honeysuckle Ridge</a> follows a different ridge to the south.</td>

Along the way, about 0.5km north of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/150">Baked Beans Bend</a>, the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/190">Honeysuckle Ridge</a> track heads up the eastern hill.
<br /><br />
After following the creek (and crossing it several times), you'll emerge from the bush into a grassy clearing. Looking to both the left and the right you'll see <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/148">Horokiwi Bridleway</a> climbing up both sides of the valley - apart from returning the way you came that's the only way out of the valley.</td>

<br /><br />
After crossing the creek several times, there is an obvious intersection.  The eastern branch is <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/136">Speedys</a> - a very steep track that heads up Boulder Hill (probably best done as a descent).  The western branch is the continuation of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/109">Kilmister</a> which climbs over a hill and drops into a narrow gully, then climbs steeply to eventually emerge next to the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/107">Hill Road</a> car park.</td>

        <td>Description</td>
        <td>A pleasant and gentle single track that follows the Korokoro stream from Petone up to the disused Korokoro Dam.  The track more-or-less follows, and is often directly built upon, the pipe that used to deliver water from the dam to Petone and beyond.  There is a smaller dam along the way to the upper dam.
<br /><br />
Some sections of track are narrow with a near-vertical drop to the stream, so some caution is advised.
<br /><br />
The track is popular with walkers, though in many places there is no room to pass and there are many blind corners, so a sedate pace would be in order.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Getting there</td>
        <td>The track starts at the end of Cornish Street, Petone.  Either return the same way, or take one of the more difficult climbs that will take you further into the Belmont Regional Park - such as <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/150">Baked Beans Bend</a> or <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/110">Oakleigh</a>.
<br /><br />
This track is also used as an exit from the Belmont Regional Park, usually via <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/151">Belmont Trig South</a> and <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/150">Baked Beans Bend</a>.</td>

<br /><br />
The northern half of the track climbs quite steeply up a farm track.  At the top of the climb, go through a gate and proceed straight ahead  across open pasture and through the gap in the hills. Then tend around towards the right and follow the fenceline to a white post in the distance.  From there, the track drops down to <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/158">Duck Creek</a>, just south of a small stand of trees.</td>

        <td>This is a steep and rough 4x4 descent from the summit of Cannons Head. Some sections of track are very steep, though the rocky surface generally provides plenty of grip.
<br /><br />
With a typical grade of 20%, and some steeper sections, this is a quick way to get from the hill tops down to the Stratton Street valley.  But it isn't all downhill - in addition to the occasional flatish bit, there's a steep, though short, climb about a third of the way down.</td>

<br /><br />
In case the climb isn't hard enough, after a particularly steep section that goes straight up a grassy hill, the track drops down a bit before the final ascent to the summit.
<br /><br />
Approaching the summit of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/101">Boulder Hill</a> you will encounter a boulder field that will probably require a bit of walking, but it isn't far.
<br /><br />
A challenging loop off <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/134">Belmont Road</a> is: climb up <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/135">Murphys</a> to the summit of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/101">Boulder Hill</a>, backtrack a bit then drop down <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/136">Speedys</a>, climb up the northern half of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/109">Kilmister</a> to the saddle point near the start of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/135">Murphys</a>, and then back up to <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/134">Belmont Road</a>.</td>

Around the highest point of the track there are a couple of grassy hills.  The track goes straight up the hills, though it is easier to slide around the western hill side along the sheep tracks.

<br /><br />
Although there are a few steps along the way, and no concessions such as switchbacks to ease the grade, the incline is mercifully short.
<br /><br />
Given its pleasant bush surroundings, this track is understandably popular with walkers and runners, so watch out for them.</td>

Technically the track doesn't actually go up to the summit of Round Knob, but rather just skirts around the side.  Ignore the lack of a track and go to the summit anyway. Then enjoy the challenge of riding down the rippled hillside surface.
<br /><br />
From the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/111">OCR Belmont</a> intersection there is an short though intimidating looking initial section that runs straight up the hill. Instead of taking the direct route, follow the easier sheep trails that zig-zig up the hill - those sheep ain't dumb.</td>

        <td>Much of this track is a cross-country trek across paddocks, following the occasional marker pole.  The final section down to <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/109">Kilmister</a>, starting at a power pylon, is on a rough 4x4 track.
<br /><br />
Overall this is a very steep track, which drops 290m from top to bottom, so probably best done in the downhill direction from <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/135">Murphys</a> to <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/109">Kilmister</a>.  The main descent has an average grade of 21%, with some parts being even steeper.
<br /><br />
At the intersection with <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/109">Kilmister</a> the track crosses a creek at a log weir.  Provided the water level is low, the weir can be ridden across.</td>

<br /><br />
From the upper grassy section there are great views over the Hutt Valley and towards Wellington Harbour.  But keep an eye on the track, as it is quite rough in places.
<br /><br />
The lower sections pass through regenerating bush, with a few tight switchbacks to slow down your descent.

<br /><br />
Although it is a difficult climb, it can be made easier by zig-zagging between the fences.  Riding down can also be difficult, due to the rough surface, but tremendous fun.
<br /><br />
If descending, watch out for the chicane under the trees.  Going straight instead of turning will take you behind a farm building - if so, just back-track a bit and drop onto the farm road through a gate under the trees, then carry on.</td>

        <td>For those who like flying uncontrollably down a ridiculously steep track towards mature pine trees, <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/116">The Slide</a> is the place to be.
<br /><br />
Throw in a track surface that - particularly on the bottom half - consists mostly of smooth, hard-packed clay, with a layer of pine needles providing the only traction, and what more could you ask for?
<br /><br />
Although <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/116">The Slide</a> and <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/105">Danzig</a> start and end at the same altitude, <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/116">The Slide</a> is much, much steeper because it goes essentially straight down the hill.  Excluding a couple of flattish bits, the chutes are at a grade of 30%+.  Overall, the track drops almost 200m over a length of less that 900m.
<br /><br />
But seriously - this is a track for dry weather only.</td>

Once they are happy with the proposed track they will allow proper construction to begin.
<br /><br />
Stage 1 has been ok-ed by WCC. This section of track will be 1.75km long and will link the top end of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/24">Car Parts</a> to the saddle at the Long Gully farm turn off. It will be single track and has an overall altitude loss of about 30 metres (when heading south). A further 0.35km long alternative route goes around the ridge at the northern end.
<br /><br />
The eventual track all the way to the summit of <a href="/area/show/2">Hawkins Hill</a> will be around 5km long.
<br /><br />
The map shows planned track in yellow and actual track in red.<br />

        <td>From Sinclair Head the track gets increasingly rough and ill-defined.  By the time you're a couple of kilometres from Karori Rock, the track has degenerated into a (large) pebble rumble with sections of unridable deep, soft sand.  At low tide it might be possible to ride on the compacted wet sand along the water line, but don't count on it.  Most likely there will be a bit of walking involved.
<br /><br />
About 1.7km from Sinclair Head there is a track diverging up the cliff face.  This initially goes to a memorial overlooking Cook Strait and then heads inland to Long Gully.</td>

        <td>Description</td>
        <td>Just past the radar dome jump over the metal barrier at a sign-posted 4wd track that deviates off the sealed road.
<br /><br />
The track initially goes up about 20m to a lookout over the deep valley below. It then drops sharply down to the right along what probably used to be a 4wd track but is now more like single track.
<br /><br />
Apart from a couple of bumps, the track descends down a ridge at around a 20% gradient until it turns across the eastern face of the hill and heads to the valley floor.
<br /><br />
The lowest point on the track is where it crosses the Waipapa Stream which meanders along the valley floor - at an altitude that is some 380m lower than the highest point. From there it is a short but steep climb up to meet the northern side of the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/234">Waipapa Loop</a>.
<br /><br />
At the intersection with <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/234">Waipapa Loop</a> the choices are to either turn left and go up the 30% gradient to <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/39">Red Rocks</a>, or go down to the valley floor (again) then up the not quite so steep but much higher southern part of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/234">Waipapa Loop</a>. Or if you're really keen you could go down to the valley floor then up <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/236">Waipapa West</a> to <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/61">Ribs</a>.</td>

        <td>This is a difficult, though fun, track down to the World War II gun emplacements and bunkers at the southern tip of the Te Kopahau Reserve overlooking Sinclair Head.
<br /><br />
From near the southern end of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/235">Te Kopahau</a> drop down a 20% slope for 1.2km. Around the bottom of this slope <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/236">Waipapa West</a> heads off down to the adjacent valley floor - though don't think that's an easy way out. If you're still keen, then continue by going up 50m over the next 0.5km. 
<br /><br />
Now comes the fun part: a rocky slide down a 30%+ slope to a saddle point. This section of track requires a fair bit of concentration and skill, as the surface is loose and very steep (though with a brief respite towards the bottom).
<br /><br />
From the saddle point there's a short climb up to the bunkers and their great views over Cook Strait.
<br /><br />
The exit from this track is a bit tricky. There are two possibilities, either:<br />
•	return the same way, which is not an attractive option due to the 300m climb up a very steep track; or<br />
•	drop down to the beach along what isn't really a track at all. To take this option, as shown on the map, go back almost 0.2km to the saddle point then turn to the east down the valley. The faint track is initially ridable but soon requires walking. Then it gets difficult - the track essentially disappears and you need to scramble down a steep, narrow and scrub-filled gully that resembles a creek more than a track. The last 0.1km is extremely steep, with a slope of around 45%. You'll emerge at the back of a bach just as the track becomes apparent again, so skirt around to the left and on to <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/63">Pariwhero</a>.</td>

Ends at the bunkers above Sinclair Head, followed by an exit strategy that involves scrambling down a gully to <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/63">Pariwhero</a> on the beach.</td>

        <td>Overview</td>
        <td>A classic Wellington track with an honest altitude change. Mostly packed rock and gravel with patches of clay on the bottom half and patches of loose gravel on the top half. The council blades this 4wd track about once a year so it is usually in good condition, however serious ruts do form after heavy rain. The surrounding hills are mostly covered in gorse which is slowly regenerating. Plenty of wild goats and rabbits for company. In late spring the lower slopes turn purple with a weed daisy that has taken hold. This track can be ridden in either direction, and is quite exposed to the northerly which can add extra challenge on the upper half. The views from the top are excellent, and on a clear day you can see all of Wellington and harbour, the Tararua mountains and the top of the South Island.</td>

        <td>Going up. The climb is in two main sections with a brief descent/rest in the middle. The climbing starts immediately at the big metal gate at the bottom. You climb up the right flank of the ridge for about 1.5k with gorse on either side of you. About 1/4 of the way up you go around a sharp left-hand bend where you can see all the way up to the old cattle yards at the half way point. The bottom third is probably the steepest but usually has the least loose gravel. There are several large water-bars to roll through. After this the gradient slowly levels off as you approach the cattle yards. The next kilometre rolls up then down as you traverse across to the next part of the climb. As you come around a large right-hand bend with the bank on your right, there is a track off to your left that goes to <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/56">Spooky Gully</a> (marked with a new signage). Stay on the main trail. Once through the saddle the climb starts again sidling to the right with more gorse. There are a few tough left-hand corners here with plenty of loose gravel which can be a real challenge to ride. There is a major intersection to Red Rocks about 400m from the top (you can see the top for the last 3rd of the ride). The turn-off is well marked and the Tip Track continues on to the right. This last section is not quite so steep as the track takes you up to a metal pole-gate at the top. If the northerly is really blowing and you want a sit down then you can usually find some shelter just below the sealed road where the Tip Track joins. Views to the South Island are best from the summit about 300m further up the sealed road.<br /><br />Coming down. This is a very fast descent. Going down you really don't notice the loose gravel patches and the main difficulty is keeping your speed down so you can make the bends comfortably. Beware the water-bars on the bottom third which can be quite deep and rutty after big rain. There are also some clay patches here which can be greasy if it has been wet.</td>

    <tr>
        <td>Getting there</td>
        <td>The bottom of the Tip Track starts at the big metal gates immediately to the left of the road to the rubbish dump off Happy Valley road (about 5km south of Brooklyn). There is signage at the gate for Te Kopuhou Reserve, and another on the gate saying "Emergency Vehicle Access".<br /><br />The top can be reached by continuing on up the sealed road from the Brooklyn wind turbine. The track starts on the left, just up from the orange concrete-block castle - beware of the dragons (dogs). Or if you are coming from the summit of Hawkins Hill it is about 300m down from the "golf ball" (Airways Corporation aircraft monitoring station) on the outside of a right-hand bend. If you pass the castle you have gone too far.</td>

Like most of the tracks in the <a href="/area/show/2">Hawkins Hill</a> area, the track surface is rocky and loose (especially when dry), which can make for a difficult climb due traction issues.  The loose surface can also make for a tricky descent on the steeper sections.
<br /><br />
The climb out of Waipapa Stream valley is steep whichever way you go, with the choices being: <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/236">Waipapa West</a>, <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/234">Waipapa Loop</a>, and <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/233">Radome</a>.</td>

        <td>From the Melling Bridge to the Ava Rail Bridge there are two alternative routes: the upper track is on the flood stop bank and has a grass/asphalt surface; the lower track is closer to the river and has a grass/gravel surface.
<br /><br />
After ducking under the Ava Rail Bridge, cross the cricket ground (or go round if in use) to the flood stop bank which then continues through the golf course.
<br /><br />
Rather than crossing Waione Street, there is a tunnel under the Hutt Estuary Bridge.  This leads to a tight and twisty little board walk around the estuary then up to the the footpath on the southern side of Waione Street.

Instead of going up to the car park, take the single track that is straight ahead.  You'll soon encounter a couple of large concrete blocks across the track, letting you know that you're going the right way.
<br /><br />
After climbing gently for a while, there is a short but quite steep descent through bush. Watch out for the wooden drainage channels, which are at acute angles across the track.  The descent ends abruptly when the track emerges into an open grassed area just before the footbridge.

Instead, it simply stops next to State Highway 2, 1.3km short of the Twin Lakes Road entry to the water treatment area.

Watch out for a set of steps in one of the bush sections, somewhere around the middle of the track.

At a small bridge, just before meeting State Highway 2, the track forks left and right. The righthand branch goes straight to State Highway 2, while the lefthand branch takes a slightly longer scenic route to meet State Highway 2 a little further along.

        <td>Immediately north of the suspension footbridge is Harcourt Park, which includes a motorcamp and signage pointing out the earthquake escarpments. There are a couple of alternative paths through the park, both of which meet Akatarawa Road by the sub-station.
<br /><br />
You can head north along Akatarawa Road or turn left into Pokaka Street then across the small park to find an obscure piece of single track. This section of track rumbles along next to the river, and seemingly passes through a couple of back yards, before rejoining Akatarawa Road.  The track is sign-posted, so the back yards are probably just the locals trying to poach a bit of extra space at the back of their sections.
<br /><br />
Just before this section of track ends, there is a rotunda shelter 0.1km south of the Birchville Bridge.

        <td>Relatively long section of track, with a variety of surface conditions. Most of the track has a gravel surface, with some gravel road, and a short section is asphalt paving.
<br /><br />
Opposite the Manor Park golf course there is an interesting piece of track that swoops along below the Eastern Hutt Road. After 0.5km you'll have the choice of a short climb back up to the Eastern Hutt Road or drifting off to the river's edge (the map shows the latter option).

From Reynolds Bach Drive to the intersection of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/225">Kiln</a> and <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/226">Pinehaven Ridge</a> is a 70m climb at a moderate 10% average grade.

There are two gates across the road - the top gate, next to the water pumping station, is locked whenever the landfill is closed; the lower gate, next to the railway museum is sometimes open when the landfill is closed but don't count on it. If you have a car, then probably best to park it on the flat next to the Eastern Hutt Road and then bike up Reynolds Bach Drive.</td>

        <td>From the steel gate at the top of Kingsley Street follow the gravel road around to the south.  After just 60m there is another pair of steel gates - jump over the lower gate (the other goes up to a water reservoir) and continue along the gravel road.
<br /><br />
Almost 1km from the start there is a Y-intersection which has a very wide gravel road heading down the hill and a narrower 4wd track heading up the hill. As of January 2009 the wide road was blocked by a deliberately placed log. Take the narrower track up the hill.
<br /><br />
The track gets progressively narrower, eventually turning into single track around 0.4km from the top. At that point there is an overgrown track that heads down the hill towards the southwest (on your right when ascending) - it is a deadend pylon access road, so take the singletrack on your left.
<br /><br />
The top 50m of this track was destroyed by logging operations which created a clearing at the intersection of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/81">ECNZ pylon road</a> and <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/226">Pinehaven Ridge</a>. In making the clearing, a large amount of tree debris and dirt was pushed into what used to be the top of this track, forming an insurmountable wall.  To climb the last few metres up to the clearing, a bypass has emerged up an existing bank. Someone has helpfully provided a rope tied to a large tree to assist with climbing up the 2m high bank.</td>

If you're in the clearing, then to find where the track enters the treeline look towards the west and there is a small dip in the dirt edge next to a couple of possum control posters stapled to a tree.</td>

        <td>From Shaftesbury Grove head along an initially rolling track until, at around the 0.8km mark, you encounter a large water tank. On the western side of the tank there is a closed track that goes down towards the actual old soil bureau. Instead of going that way, head up the hill on the southern side of the water tank and continue to the summit.
<br /><br />
From the summit, the track drops 200m down to the Eastern Hutt Road at an almost constant 18% gradient.
<br /><br />
Most of the track is a narrow sealed road, though the seal is getting a bit rough around the edges.</td>

        <td>Heading up from the intersection with <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/232">Goodwin Drive</a> and <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/225">Kiln</a>, the track is initially steep with a deeply rutted clay surface.
<br /><br />
As shown on the map, after just 0.15km you'll encounter a Y-intersection. The left-hand branch is flatish and looks inviting, while the right-hand branch heads up a steep and rutted track. Take your pick: the left-hand branch is initially easy but at the apex turns into a steep and deeply rutted climb; the right-hand branch is initially a steep and deeply rutted climb and then gets flatter. The right-hand branch is probably slightly easier. The alternatives rejoin 0.25km up the right-hand branch.
<br /><br />
Around 1.1km from the start you'll meet a T-intersection. Turn right uphill, since the left-hand branch ends 0.1km downhill (as shown on the map). From this intersection to the large clearing at the top the track surface is more of a forestry road, being generally much firmer and smoother.
<br /><br />
If heading down from the large forestry clearing, it might be easier to get confused by the several tracks that branch off this one. In most cases the way to go is fairly obvious - just stick to the main road. However, there are a couple of intersections to note:<br />
- About 0.3km from the top there is a Y-intersection. Take the right-hand road that heads slightly down (rather than heading up to the left).<br />
- About 1.7km from the top there is a track that branches off at 90 degrees to the left while what appears to be the main track continues straight ahead and slightly down (this is the T-intersection 1.1km from the bottom, as mentioned above). The straight ahead track actually ends 0.1km further along in a circular clearing. If you end up there, then backtrack and take the other branch.</td>

        <td>This track was used as the downhill course of the 1998 national mountain biking championships.  It is a steep track through mature pine forest, consisting of short, fast sections and technical challenges such as rock obstacles, tree roots, and a 1m drop.
<br /><br />
Two-thirds of the way down there is a set of steps which have a bypass to the left. At the bottom of the steps, turn sharply to the left, rather than following the more obvious track straight down the hill.
<br /><br />
With construction of a new track in and around the clearing, the bottom end of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/88">98 Downhill</a> will be realigned at some stage.
<br /><br />
The track had fallen into a state of disrepair.  There were several large trees across the track, making it unridable without dismounting.  With work from volunteers and the Wellington City Council, the track was cleared in late 2008.</td>

        <td>This is probably the most technical track in the park (sometimes that honour goes to <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/13">Vertigo</a> when it's been wet). It descends for most of the height of the Peak. A nice mixture of flowing single track with natural rock jumps, and squiggly bush shenanigans. Some rocky sections and some clay.</td>

You can also exit <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/12">Zac's Track</a> about 1/4 of the way down via a 10 metre grassy slope - near a section of flax.</td>

<br /><br />
This track has changed a lot over the years. In the early days the final rocky drop into the stream was the crux of the track but now it's pretty straight forward. Then up until May 08 the very top left-hander was a gotcha, especially when dry. Now that has been tidied nicely. Currently the most technical section is provided as an option (marked with triple-x sign, about 0.5km from the top) with a decent rocky exit drop that has next to no run-out before you make a sharp right hander. One for the experts methinks.</td>

Keep heading up hill and to the north until, after about 0.3km, you emerge into an open grass area. Just before the grass area is an intersection with <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/230">Lookout Scenic</a>, which heads off in the opposite direction towards the southeast.
<br /><br />
In the grassy area, swing around to the right and up a steep section to join <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/144">Southern Mt Victoria</a> at the point where it veers around to the east towards Palliser Road. <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/144">Southern Mt Victoria</a> and <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/229">Lookout Walkway</a> coincide for 0.2km, so just continue up the hill towards the southeast. At the next major intersection (which is also the end of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/230">Lookout Scenic</a>) head up to the left and then sidle around the hill just below Lookout Road.
<br /><br />
About 0.25m from the last grass area you'll encounter the final intersection. The left-hand branch continues to Lookout Road via a set of steps (which can be ridden down, if you stay on the left-hand side of the steps), while the right-hand branch goes straight up to the main car park just below the summit.</td>

        <td>From Pirie Street climb up a wide and mostly easy track. You'll cross the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/147">Hataitai to City</a> after about 0.1km, but continue up the hill for a further 0.3km.
<br /><br />
At the marked intersection with the alternative <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/231">Mt Vic Summit</a> branch, turn right and head up the hill.  The alternative branch starts on <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/229">Lookout Walkway</a> 0.15m to the north, and also has <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/230">Lookout Scenic</a> veering off about one third of the way along.
<br /><br />
Once the alternative branches merge follow the signs for about 0.25km up to the intersection of Alexandra Road and Lookout Road, including a very short section where the track coincides with <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/144">Southern Mt Victoria</a>.
<br /><br />
Cross the road and climb straight up a grassy knob to the pyryimid shaped <a href="http://www.wellington.govt.nz/services/arts/publicart/gallery.php?type=memorial&page=1">Richard Evelyn Byrd Memorial</a>. From there, cross the car park and climb up either the steps or the adjacent grass to the summit look out.</td>

        <td><br />
Start from the metal barrier on the southeast side of the velodrome. Do a clockwise partial lap of the velodrome then head north through the car park and up the sealed exit road. Turn sharply left and go up past a metal barrier at the steep start of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/147">Hataitai to City</a> until you reach and cross Alexandra Road.
<br /><br /><br />
Turn right along <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/144">Southern Mt Victoria</a> and shadow Alexandra Road for 0.55km until just past a loop road. At that point leave the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/144">Southern Mt Victoria</a> (which drops down into the trees) and take the loop road up to the intersection of Alexandra Road and Lookout Road.  Continue around to the left and then the right on the verge of Lookout Road until you reach the main summit car park.
<br /><br /><br />
Turn left down the steep end of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/229">Lookout Walkway</a>.  Stay left through a couple of intersections for 0.45km, leaving the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/229">Lookout Walkway</a> via some single track to briefly follow the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/144">Southern Mt Victoria</a> track. Take a shortcut down to the right and follow <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/231">Mt Vic Summit</a> north for 0.25km. Veer right at the next Y intersection up <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/230">Lookout Scenic</a> for a 0.1km long steep climb up under the Macrocarpa trees. Then take the very steep rooty right turn up another 0.1km to the top of the open grass field.
<br /><br /><a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/145">Charles Plimmer</a><br />
Turn left and descend <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/144">Southern Mt Victoria</a> across the grass. About 20m into the trees turn right down a single track. Turn left then acute right to the top of an extremely steep ski slope chute.  Plummet down (or go around) the chute, watching out for the step down at the bottom. Continue down some rolling track then, instead of dropping down to the sealed path, turn left up a narrow and rooty track to an open grass area where you join the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/145">Charles Plimmer</a> track.
<br /><br /><a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/145">Charles Plimmer</a><br />
Follow <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/145">Charles Plimmer</a> for 0.2km until leaving it and heading up hill from a hairpin corner. Climb up for 0.05km then drop down for almost 0.1km to the right towards Charles Plimmer Park. Climb 0.05km up the grass to follow the cliff edge above Charles Plimmer Park. Head south for 0.8km, crossing the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/229">Lookout Walkway</a>, Dovetail, and then <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/231">Mt Vic Summit</a> as you climb up into a circular grove of mature trees close to Alexandra Road.
<br /><br /><br />
From the grove, turn sharply right down an initially steep and tricky piece of single track and continue around to the right for 0.4km until you drop on to <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/147">Hataitai to City</a>. Turn sharply left on <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/147">Hataitai to City</a> and head south for 0.5km, climbing back up to Alexandra Road (to the point that was also the end of Stage 1).
<br /><br /><br />
Turn right down the single track and at the Y-intersection veer right and continue a total of 0.4km to Alexandra Park. Cross Alexandra Park and climb up the middle of the bank opposite. Take the single track up and along the cliff then down a tricky and twisty track, complete with drop off the end of a wooden structure, to exit on to the seal outside the old Fever Hospital – or take the easier path down <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/144">Southern Mt Victoria</a> to rejoin on the seal.
<br /><br /><br />
Don't cross Alexandra Road yet – instead, jump the kerb and head 0.35km south along some single track that runs parallel to Alexandra Road, cross an open field then around to a small parking area off Alexandra Road.  Now cross Alexandra Road and turn right to head south on <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/144">Southern Mt Victoria</a> for 0.45km, passing through mature trees and across an open field then more trees, to a hairpin bend adjacent to the roundabout at the intersection of Constable Street, Wellington Road, and Crawford Road.
<br /><br /><br />
At the roundabout fly around the berm then gather enough speed to climb up the steep bank 0.1km opposite – known as the Big Dipper. Continue another 0.15km up through the trees and cross the same field as before (though 10m downhill). Exit the clearing into the trees and continue for 0.3km then take the first left uphill for 0.05km. Turn right at the T-intersection onto <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/146">Newtown to Hataitai</a> and follow this track for the remaining 0.4km back to where you started next to the velodrome.</td>

        <td>Starting from the southern end, at the intersection of Wellington Road and Crawford Road, the track immediately branches into two alternatives: the upper alternative goes through the trees; while the lower alternative sweeps across the open grassed area parallel with Wellington Road.  The alternatives merge after 0.1km.
<br /><br />
Proceed a further 0.25km up to Alexandra Road.  The track shares 0.1km in common with <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/146">Newtown to Hataitai</a> before diverging and following Alexandra Road for 0.3km.
<br /><br />
Cross Alexandra Road at a car park outside the old Fever Hospital.  Climb the track on the northern side of the car park to the north-eastern corner of Alexandra Park.  At that point, either walk up the set of steps then sweep back down to Alexandra Road, or go along Alexandra Road for 0.3km to a map display which is the intersection with <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/147">Hataitai to City</a>.
<br /><br />
Continue 0.5km along the verge of Alexandra Road (on the western side), then go into the trees and follow the marked track for 0.6km. Around 0.1km along this section the track crosses, and briefly coincides with, <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/231">Mt Vic Summit</a>. The last 0.2km of this section coincides with <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/229">Lookout Walkway</a>.
<br /><br />
At the top of a steep drop down to an open grass area, instead of going down the hill turn sharply to the right along a wide unmarked track.  This section of track gets progressively more technical, with lots of exposed tree roots and narrow parts.  There is a set of steps just before the track ends on Palliser Road.</td>

Despite the difficult middle section, this track is one of the few connections across the Horokiwi hills.

        <td>Starting from the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/160">Old Coach Road</a> saddle point, head up the grassy slope in the general direction of Mount Kau Kau.  The track looks like little more than a sheep track in places, but it is defined well enough to follow OK. A switchback has been added at the first (small) saddle to allow one to ride the steep uphill heading south.
<br /><br />
After crossing a ridge, the track drops down into a shallow valley.  Thanks to the Kennett Bros and WCC the rocky scramble is now a sweet series of two beginner level switchbacks up to the intersection with the track (walkers only) coming up from Truscott Avenue, Johnsonville. Take note of the loving care that the lower switchback has been chiselled and benched out from the rock - it is a piece of art...From here the track becomes more clearly defined - being a rocky trail for most of the remaining climb to the summit.
<br /><br />
There are a couple of very steep tracks heading off to the east - these drop down to the park at the end of Truscott Avenue and are not suitable for bikes.
<br /><br />
A bit further along is an intersection with <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/161">Sirsi</a> - either down a short, steep track or after a narrow piece of rocky singletrack.
<br /><br />
About 0.35km past the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/161">Sirsi</a> intersection, the track splits into two parts: the narrower track on the left is easier, whereas the other track is great fun on the way down.  The alternatives rejoin next to a gate and stile.
<br /><br />
The remaining 0.4km to the summit is very steep.  However, the effort is rewarded with spectacular views over large parts of the Wellington region.  The views are absolutely gorgeous on a fine, calm day - especially from the viewling platform - but the summit is horrendously exposed to the wind from all directions so prepare accordingly.
<br /><br />
From the summit, head to the west along <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/32">Skyline</a>, or return back the way you came.  The track that heads down towards Khandallah is closed to bikes.</td>

<br /><br />
The other end is at the summit of Mount Kau Kau.  There are only two legitimate ways to get there by bike:  this track, or via <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/32">Skyline</a>.</td>

From there, follow the track up and around the head of the valley to a saddle point overlooking Ohariu Valley.  It is from this point that <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/159">Kau Kau</a> heads up the grassy slope.
<br /><br />
As you start the descent into Ohariu Valley the track becomes a 4x4 road.  After winding its way down the hill, at an easy grade of around 5%, the track ends when it meets Rifle Range Road.</td>

<br /><br />
Parts of the track are quite steep, especially towards the Colchester Crescent end.
<br /><br />
From the open grassy area near the Mark Avenue end, an alternative exit is to climb a short but steep 4WD track up to Bushland Grove.</td>

        <td>Although this track is never much more than 300m from houses, there is quite a sense of being in the middle of nowhere as you swoop down through the forest.  From the ridge there are glimpses of Tawa through the trees towards the east, but just ignore them and enjoy the ride.  This sense of isolation is heightened as you drop into a seemingly secluded valley - until you suddenly emerge into a suburban street.
<br /><br />
Some sections of track are fairly steep and lack a firm surface.  Of greater concern is the rickety old gate and couple of large trees across the track at head height.  Beware.</td>

The entry point is becoming more obvious with use, but if you miss it and instead meet the intersection with <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/168">Spicer Forest</a>, then backtrack 0.2km and have another go.

After a romp through the forest wilderness, the track emerges into civilisation in the form of an accessway that leads to Kiwi Crescent, Tawa.</td>

        <td>By connecting Ngauranga Gorge with Newlands, this track is mostly used by bike commuters heading into or from the city or the Hutt.
<br /><br />
It is a decent climb, gaining 160m in altitude at a constant grade of just over 10%.
<br /><br />
The surface is firm and fairly even, with a hard-packed gravel and clay base.  However, watch out for the four deep concrete drains that cut across the track.  Sometimes they are filled with gravel, making them shallow and easy to cross.  But at other times they are clear and can be awkward if descending at speed.</td>

Or climb up from the bottom of Ngauranga Gorge.  It is not possible the cross Centennial Highway in that vicinty, so you're stuck with being on the northern side of the road whichever way you're going.</td>

        <td>This is a very pleasant and gentle track with a nice outlook over the harbour.
<br /><br />
Although the track is narrow in places, there's nothing at all technical along the way - except, perhaps, the cattle that are sometimes present.
<br /><br />
Watch out for the low wire rope barriers across the track - easy to step over, but tricky to ride over.  There are also a couple of fences/stiles to contain the cattle.</td>

        <td>This tracks starts with a gentle climb through the centre of Whitireia Park, approaching from the south to reach a saddle point overlooking Onehunga Bay.
<br /><br />
Near the saddle point, the wide and well groomed track stops and is replaced with a narrow track that is more like a trench in places.  The descent down to the bay is quite difficult, especially if the track has been cut up by the cattle that frequent the area.</td>

        <td>From Ladle Bend, the track climbs up to meet <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/217">Dela Rosa</a>.  It then turns into a valley that runs parallel to the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/213">Rimutaka Rail Trail</a>, drops down a little to <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/221">Miro Creek</a> and then climbs more-or-less steadily to a saddle point where <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/219">Centre Ridge</a> branches off to the local summit.
<br /><br />
Just 40m after the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/219">Centre Ridge</a> corner, the track splits into two branches.  The lower branch is <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/220">Pig Gully</a>, while <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/218">Back Road</a> continues on the upper branch to climb a bit further and then drop down to rejoin <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/213">Rimutaka Rail Trail</a> at the summit plateau.
<br /><br />
There is a reasonable amount of climbing when heading from north to south - around 200m altitude gain in total, at a typical gradient of 10% and occasionally up to 15%.
<br /><br />
If doing a there-and-back trip on the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/213">Rimutaka Rail Trail</a>, then an interesting alternative to the first part of the return trip might be to go (mostly down) via the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/218">Back Road</a>.</td>

        <td>The summit of Centre Ridge is the location of one of Greater Wellington Regional Council's automatic hydrological monitoring stations. Although the monitoring station isn't much to look at, the views certainly are. 
<br /><br />
From the summit of this peak there are spectacular views of the surrounding mountains - which are mostly 200-300m higher with deep valleys inbetween, giving the impression of standing on the raised centre of a huge bowl. The summit is only 60m higher that the turnoff from <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/218">Back Road</a>, so the short climb is well worth the effort.

From the car park, the track climbs up a mostly gentle (apart from a couple of short, sharp bits) hill through the bush, alongside Cross Creek. At the upper end there is a bridge over Cross Creek immediately before emerging from the scrub into the old rail yards.
<br /><br />
Once you reach the rail yards, the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/212">Rimutaka Incline</a> heads up the hill to your left (west).  The old rail yards end 0.3km to your right (east), which might be worth exploring before heading up the hill.</td>

<br /><br />
Follow the mostly straight road for about 9km until Cross Creek Road branches off to the right.  The gravel Cross Creek Road continues for another 1km before ending at a car park, which is the start of the track.</td>

        <td>The track initially ascends about 40m from the Rimutaka Hill Road.  Then, apart from a couple of short ascents, the track descends 235m at a near constant 9-11% gradient to meet <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/218">Back Road</a> less than 0.5km from the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/213">Rimutaka Rail Trail</a>.
<br /><br />
Along the way there are intermittent patches of tarseal. Given the well formed nature of the otherwise gravel road, it is possible that the road was once sealed throughout its entire length.  In any case, the road surface is smooth and firm - making for a fast descent and relatively easy ascent.</td>

        <td>Description</td>
        <td>This is a fairly typical winding forestry road that climbs part way up Goat Rock. Its most redeeming feature is that it provides a connection between either the Tunnel Gully Recreation Area or the Kaitoke Regional Park through to the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/213">Rimutaka Rail Trail</a> and subsequent tracks.
<br /><br />
The final drop down to meet the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/213">Rimutaka Rail Trail</a> is steep and twisty, making for a fun descent (or a difficult climb).</td>

<br /><br />
Ends at a T-intersection with <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/213">Rimutaka Rail Trail</a>, 2.7km from the car park.</td>

        <td>Other notes</td>
        <td>Warning: This track passes about 0.7km behind the business end of the deerstalkers rifle range.  At around the halfway mark of this track, near an intersection with a road that looks like it goes down to the airstrip, there is a sign that says "DANGER! Rifle range safety zone. Do not leave the road and go downhill".
<br /><br />
It looks like there will be some forestry action in this area during 2009, so watch out for logging trucks and closure signs.</td>

        <td>Description</td>
        <td>The northern half of this track is a typical 4wd road, with nothing out of the ordinary. However, the other half is an undulating - and in some places quite rough - track that goes straight down the hill along the edge of a pine forest. It seems more like a fire break than a track, so perhaps its primary purpose is actually as a fire break for the forest.
<br /><br />
In any case, there are several short, sharp rollercoaster style undulations along the generally downhill trend when travelling from south to north. Some of the short ascents will likely require a bit of walking.
<br /><br />
If starting from the water treatment plant end, then <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/206">Pylon Loop</a> veers off towards the east after about 0.75km. Ascending <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/206">Pylon Loop</a> and the descending <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/207">Kaitoke Hill</a> is a much easier option than climbing <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/207">Kaitoke Hill</a>.</td>

<br /><br />
A spur roughly in the middle of the track heads down towards the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/213">Rimutaka Rail Trail</a>.  Although the Google aerial photo suggests that the track almost reaches the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/213">Rimutaka Rail Trail</a>, in fact it stops well short - actually only about 75m at the closest point, but with 2-3m tall pine trees (as at 4 January 2009) and dense gorse and scrub inbetween, there is no obvious way to reach the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/213">Rimutaka Rail Trail</a>.  Perhaps a connection will be possible when the trees have grown sufficiently to thin the scrub, but not yet.</td>

The track is barely formed, and hence rather rough in places, but makes for an interested diversion from the forest road.
<br /><br />
On the Google Map it appears that this track continues on the southern side of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/206">Pylon Loop</a> towards State Highway 2. Perhaps it once did, though on the ground things are much more overgrown than they were when that aerial photo was taken so such an extension doesn't really exist any more.</td>

Despite its name, this isn't actually a loop. However, a loop can be formed by adding <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/207">Kaitoke Hill</a>. In fact, if you're starting from the Kaitoke Regional Park, then climbing <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/206">Pylon Loop</a> and descending <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/207">Kaitoke Hill</a> is much easier than taking the reverse route.
<br /><br />
For the more adventurous, take the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/214">Powerline Shortcut</a> as an alternative to some of this track.
<br /><br />
A short detour is also available from the eastern-most apex, where <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/215">Pylon Loop Extension</a> is a spur.</td>

        <td>Description</td>
        <td>This track follows the famous Rimutaka Incline railway line. From part way through the Summit Tunnel down to the rail yards the slope is typically 1 in 15 - a modest gradient for a mountain bike, but extremely steep for a railway line.
<br /><br />
Along the way there are three tunnels to pass through (in order, from the top): Summit Tunnel (576m long), Siberia Tunnel (108m long), and Prices Tunnel (98m long). It is advisable to take a light of some form for the Summit Tunnel.  Although the Summit Tunnel is straight - so the other end is always visible - it can be quite a disorienting experience with only the light at the far end of the tunnel for guidence. The other tunnels are curved but are sufficiently short that they don't really require a light (though having a light wouldn't hurt).
<br /><br />
About 0.4km down hill from the Summit Tunnel there is a lookout (down a spur) that provides sweeping views of the valley.  The views are worth the short diversion.
<br /><br />
Just below the Siberia Tunnel is Horseshoe Gully - otherwise known as "Siberia" due to the local micro-climate. There was a curved earth embankment across the gully until, in 1967, it was washed away. Now there is a deep gully that has signs stating "Steep, slippery approach to creek bed. Cyclists are advised to dismount and walk". Chances are you'll have to dismount to cross the creek and ascend the other side anyway. Note that the track on the summit side of the gully is about 25m upstream of the track on the Cross Creek side.
<br /><br />
As would be expected from an old railway line, the track itself is fairly smooth and evenly graded with gentle curves. Nonetheless, watch out for the occasional rut and stone on the track - especially if descending at speed.
<br /><br />
The bottom of the track is at the old rail yards that formed the Cross Creek Station and settlement. From there, either return back up the incline or continue along the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/211">Cross Creek</a> track.</td>

<br /><br />
Bottom end is at the old rail yards, from which <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/211">Cross Creek</a> provides access to the exit road.</td>

        <td>Description</td>
        <td>This track is built on the old Wellington-Wairarapa railway line, leading to the summit of the famous <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/212">Rimutaka Incline</a>. The track is a popular area for recreation, due to its easy grade, rugged scenery, historical significance, and easy accessibility.
<br /><br />
Being an old railway line, the track's gradient is easy and consistent, averaging around 1% (uphill from the car park). The track surface is generally smooth and well-maintained.
<br /><br />
Around 0.6km from the car park you'll pass the deerstalkers rifle range - but don't worry, they should be shooting away from the track.
<br /><br />
Along the way you'll pass through the Pakuratahi Tunnel (91m long, and curved - so a light would be helpful but isn't necessary) plus cross several bridges. 
<br /><br />
From the summit, either return the same way or continue through the 576m long Summit Tunnel along the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/212">Rimutaka Incline</a> to <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/211">Cross Creek</a>.
<br /><br />
If doing a there-and-back trip on the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/213">Rimutaka Rail Trail</a>, then an interesting alternative to the first part of the return trip might be to go (initially up and then mostly down) via the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/218">Back Road</a>.
<br /><br />
There are camping facilities on the summit plateau and at the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/216">Pakuratahi River Camp</a>. See <a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/tracks-and-walks/wellington/wairarapa/rimutaka-rail-trail/">DOC</a> for more information.</td>

        <td>Getting there</td>
        <td>Starts from a car park about 1.5km down a gravel road off a well signposted exit from State Highway 2. An alternative entry is to take <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/210">Goat Rock</a>, which joins 2.7km from the car park.
<br /><br />
Ends at the summit rail yards.</td>

Note that the area looks quite different to that shown in the Google map.  State Highway 2 was being reconstructed when that aerial photo was taken, but is now long since completed.  In particular, State Highway 2 has an underpass from the Kaitoke Regional Park through to the Kaitoke Loop Road. Also, much of the pine forest on the southern side of State Highway 2 has been cleared and replanted.</td>

Other parts of the line can be seen in the Tunnel Gully Recreation Area (especially in the Maymorn area) and, of course, in the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/213">Rimutaka Rail Trail</a> which starts almost 2km to the east of this track's northern end.
<br /><br />
The track itself is smooth, with a gentle grade, and large radius corners - as would be expected from an old railway line. In the middle is a short diversion across an old railway bridge, whereas the road goes around and rejoins 0.1km further along.
<br /><br />
Follow this track from the Tunnel Gully Recreational Area to the intersection of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/208">Station Connection</a> and <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/210">Goat Rock</a>.

        <td>Traversing Fitzroy Bay this road provides access to the popular rock climbing area around Baring Head.
<br /><br />
The road gets progressively rougher, eventually degenerating into little more than a rough 4x4 track.  For the last 200m the road almost disappears entirely, with a soft sand surface that is extremely difficult to ride when dry.
<br /><br />
At least 40 shipwrecks have been recorded along the coastline between Eastbourne and Baring Head. The small, steel-hulled steamer Paiaka, which was wrecked in 1906, is beside the road 450m past the outlet of Lake Kohangatera.</td>

        <td>Description</td>
        <td>Lake Kohanapiripiri is an important ecological area, consisting of a freshwater lake and associated wetland area.  This track skirts the western lake shore before crossing the wetland via a 70m long boardwalk and heading up to <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/92">Cameron Ridge</a>.
<br /><br />
Parts of the tracks are narrow and somewhat technical, with a few rocks and tree roots to negotiate along the way.
<br /><br />
Watch out for a couple of sections where the track crosses boggy bits - the mud is deeper than it looks.
<br /><br />
A short detour is available up to the Lake Kohanapiripiri lookup.</td>

    <tr>
        <td>Getting there</td>
        <td>800m past the Lower Pencarrow Lighthouse, towards <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/90">Baring Head</a>, a gravel road veers off to the left.  If you cross the outlet of Lake Kohanapiripiri then you've gone too far.  Follow the road around the western shore of Lake Kohanapiripiri, through two gates, to the base of a valley that leads up to the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/97">Upper Lighthouse</a>.  Cross over the small wooden walkway and follow the track around the shoreline.
<br /><br />
Alternatively, climb to the top of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/92">Cameron Ridge</a> and keep going north until you find the sign posted end of this track.</td>

<br /><br />
This track connects Lake Kohanapiripiri and Lake Kohangatera, providing opportunities for doing a loop around both lakes.</td>

From there, backtrack 40m and follow the recently added connection towards Lake Kohangatera via a very steep descent.  Cross the wetland via a 100m long boardwalk.</td>

        <td>This used to be a dead-end track, from <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/93">Kohanapiripiri</a> and back.  With the addition in late 2007 of a short section of track and boardwalk across the wetland, it is now possible to circumnavigate Lake Kohangatera.
<br /><br />
If traveling anti-clockwise around the Lake Kohangatera, you’ll have two steep climbs to complete, so probably best to go from the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/92">Cameron Ridge</a> end.

<br /><br />
Unlike most parts of Wellington, the road is flat - it follows the rocky beach and deviates no more that a couple of metres in elevation.
<br /><br />
This road is very popular with walkers and bikers, being especially busy on fine, calm days.
<br /><br />
From the Lower Lighthouse, continue towards <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/90">Baring Head</a> for access to the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/97">Upper Lighthouse</a>.  Alternatively, wander inland for loops around Lake <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/93">Kohanapiripiri</a> or Lake <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/94">Kohangatera</a>, including <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/92">Cameron Ridge</a> and <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/98">Valley View Hill</a>.</td>

There is a locked steel gate 250m from Burdens Gate, but some vehicles have access so watch out for them.</td>

        <td>Being an exposed coastal road, it is probably best to avoid this area when there is a strong northerly wind, otherwise the return trip to Eastbourne can be a hard slog.
<br /><br />
Dogs are prohibited along the coastal road during the lambing season, from 1 August to 31 October each year. At all other times dogs must be kept on a leash.</td>

        <td>Climbing up to the Upper Lighthouse adds a bit of spice to the relatively sedate <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/89">Pencarrow</a> journey.
<br /><br />
The first half of the climb from <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/93">Kohanapiripiri</a> is easy, while the second half is steeper (though in bite-size sections).  The effort is worthwhile, as the lighthouse offers stunning views of Wellington harbour and Cook Strait.
<br /><br />
Deep scouring around the base of the lighthouse gives an indication of the wild weather sometimes seen in this area.
<br /><br />
From the last flat area before the summit, you can take a detour to <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/91">Bluff Point</a> lookout.</td>

<br /><br />
From there, head towards the upper lighthouse.</td>

        <td>The Pencarrow lighthouses were opened in 1859, in response to the frequent shipwrecks along this coastal region.  They were New Zealand’s first permanent lighthouses.
<br /><br />
Three-quarters of the way up the hill, and overlooking the harbour, there is a small white fenced area that marks the grave of a lighthouse keeper's daughter.</td>

The lookout provides great views over Lake Kohangatera and the surrounding hills to the north and east.

The climb is slightly less difficult from the southern end, so usually done from that direction.  Either return the same way, or continue down the other side of the hill to rejoin Lake Kohangatera 0.8km from where it meets the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/95">Kohangatera Lookout</a> boardwalk.

        <td>Overview</td>
        <td>A flowing twisty single track through a tunnel of regenerating scrub. A base of gravel and rock with a rich dark dirt cover can get very messy when wet. Due to the close bush cover and south-east aspect this track takes a long time to dry out and can stay wet for most of the winter. It can be ridden in either direction but is most popular as a descent. There are good views over Wellington and harbour from the top, and even some glimpses of the Kaikoura mountains.</td>

You then traverse along for about 50m before you pass a major ridge heading south on your right. Along this ridge is the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/26">Maori Gully</a> track. <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/24">Car Parts</a> then enters the bush and is narrow and nearly all downhill with one short uphill section that cannot be coasted up. At the top of this there is a blue refrigerator, but no time for refreshments as it's all downhill from here to the end. The track suddenly emerges from the bush at a grassy area next to the sealed road. Cross here to join the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/25">Fenceline</a> track. Or there is a short zig zag across the grass to the next corner on the sealed road if you want to carry on to Brooklyn.</td>

There is a bike-friendly style between the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/25">Fenceline</a> and the sealed road, and <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/24">Car Parts</a> is directly across from this.</td>

        <td>This track runs alongside the eastern bank of Black Creek, traversing much of the length of Wainuiomata in a north-south direction.
<br /><br />
Not that there is actually a track, as such, for most of the way.  It is more of an open grassy area that is accessible to bikers, walkers, and runners.
<br /><br />
Although the track runs for over 3km through a surburban area, it crosses only one road (Nelson Crescent).  Along the way there are several foot bridges over the creek, a couple of ditches to negotiate, and a bunch of deadend roads that ajoin the track.
<br /><br />
Unusually for the <a href="/state/show/1">Wellington</a> area, this track is essentially flat.
<br /><br />
If you continue north for 1.7km along Upper Fitzherbert Road you'll find the bottom of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/200">Upper Fitzherbert</a>. At the Nelson Crescent intersection, if you head 0.75km west you'll find the bottom of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/76">Konini Firebreak</a>.</td>

        <td>This road is a popular route for a variety of recreational users.  It is primarily of interest because it provides access to a variety of tracks that branch off it, including tracks in the <a href="/area/show/8">Wainuiomata trail project</a>, <a href="/area/show/9">Wainuiomata</a>, and <a href="/area/show/17">Hutt Valley</a> areas.
<br /><br />
Some parts of the road are quite steep, but the surface is maintained in good condition which makes the climbs a bit easier than they would be on a single track.
<br /><br />
The road was built to provide access to the high voltage transmission line that runs along the ridge. There are also a couple of prominent communications towers, which also attract some service vehicle traffic.</td>

        <td>A gentle amble through gums trees and regenerating native bush, this track provides a pleasant entry to the Wainuiomata Waterworks Recreation Area.
<br /><br />
Points of interest include picnic spots along the river and the ruins of houses used by workers during construction of the reservoir dam.
<br /><br />
The “loop” part of the track name refers to the option of crossing the Wainuiomata River via a pair of bridges – a truss bridge near the start of the track, and a swing bridge at the end of the track – and wandering along the sealed Reservoir Road.
<br /><br />
Track conditions are a mix of mostly 4x4 plus single track and open grass.

        <td>Description</td>
        <td>This track traverses the Harry Todd Reserve off Hine Road. Although this track is clearly sign posted at both ends, it doesn't appear to get much traffic, which is a shame because it is a challenging track set in pleasant bush surroundings.
<br /><br />
The tricky parts of this track are the very tight hairpin bends and the occasional steps.
<br /><br />
Many of the hairpin bends are very difficult to ride up/down, particularly those with exposed tree roots. In several places there are back-to-back hairpin bends.
<br /><br />
Climbing from the eastern end (Willis Grove) is easier because most of the steps are towards the western end. The steps tend to be small boards stuck in the ground, rather than formal structures, so most can be either ridden down or bypassed. A few of the steps are more difficult - especially those off the lower end of a bridge that is about half way between the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/203">Mount Crowther</a> intersection and the Hine Road end (ie. about 0.45km from Hine Road).
<br /><br />
If you want to get to the top of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/203">Mount Crowther</a>, then climbing this track (from the Willis Grove end) is the easiest way.</td>

        <td>The firebreak runs along a ridge from Parkway, past a water reservoir on Round Hill, then up to the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/81">ECNZ pylon road</a> above Mount Towai.
<br /><br />
Although the track can be ridden in either direction, it is easier as a descent.
<br /><br />
If heading up hill, the initial climb from Parkway is up a steep 4x4 road.  After that, the track gets progressively rougher, and occasionally steeper.  There are a few rolling hills along the way, but the inclination is generally upwards.  Most riders will need to walk/push up some of the way.
<br /><br />
The track surface is mostly a mixture of clay and bare rock.  Some of the steeper sections are deeply rutted and littered with crumbling rock, providing a challenge - especially when wet.
<br /><br />
In several places the track split briefly into the firebreak proper and narrower detours.  The detours are generally easier.</td>

        <td>Getting there</td>

The top is reached via the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/81">ECNZ pylon road</a>.  There are no markings to indicate the top of the track.  If approaching from the south, look for a track to your right on a lefthand corner, about 2.3 km from the Wainuiomata Road saddle car park or 1.5 km from the top of Spoonhill.  The track goes past pylon 26.
<br /><br />
Don't be fooled by a gorse-covered 4x4 track 0.8 km up from the top of Spoonhill - it is a dead-end access track that goes to pylon 27.
<br /><br />
If approaching from the north, along <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/81">ECNZ pylon road</a>, then don't be confused by a similar looking track about 0.25km south of the bottom of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/162">Outer Loop</a>.  That track ends at the back of a private farm off the end of Stockdale Street.</td>

        <td>From the T-intersection with <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/202">Harry Todd</a>, there is a 0.3km long piece of singletrack up to a small plateau. There you'll find a communications tower and a couple of buildings. The rest of the track is a steep 4wd road to the end of Sunny Grove.
<br /><br /> 
After rolling up and down some small hills, there is a very steep (25-30%) section up to the summit.
<br /><br />
Then the fun begins. The track drops straight down a ridge - losing 250m in altitude in just over a kilometre.  Parts of this drop are extremely steep, having a gradient in the range 30-35%. Excellent brakes, or more than a touch of madness, are called for on this descent as there is no where to bail out and little respite from the relentless pull of gravity.
<br /><br />
At the bottom of the hill is a chicane followed by a tame exit to Sunny Grove.</td>

        <td>Description</td>
        <td>Following a ridge from the Wainuiomata saddle to the summit of Mount Lowry, this is a difficult climb through classic bush-covered hills.  Much of the track is narrow and twisting, with a surface consisting of root-infested leaf detritus.
<br /><br />
The initial short, sharp climb is followed by rolling hills for about 1km.  Then the real work begins - an altitude gain of 135m over a distance of 0.9km, at an average grade of 15%, made all the more difficult by the uneven track surface. There are a few steps and several sections where there would be steps if not for the tree roots.
<br /><br />
The climbing effort is worthwhile, though, with a great technical descent either returning the same way or continuing on to <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/83">Rata Ridge</a>.
<br /><br />
There is a lookout near the start of the track, plus several other lookouts along the way, providing spectacular views over Wellington harbour and the Wainuiomata valley.</td>

<br /><br />
Soon you'll drop down the first of three outrageously steep descents. There is a narrow singletrack on the left which bypasses the steepest section of the first descent.  From there continue along to a Y-intersection and take the right-hand (northeastern) branch.
<br /><br />
After the third descent you'll rejoin <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/81">ECNZ pylon road</a> having dropped a total of 115m, including the short ascents inbetween. With grades of 25-40% – along with drops, ruts, and loose rock – this is a challenging descent even in the best of conditions.  If the surface is wet, then forget about it.</td>

At the bridge, instead of crossing the river veer into the bush just upstream of the large pipe.

        <td>As the name suggests, this track traverses Rata Ridge from near the summit of Mount Lowry down to the Wainuiomata valley.
<br /><br />
Apart from one short climb, it is downhill essentially all the way.  Most of the descent is slow, with a narrow and uneven track surface to contend with.  Towards the Stanley Street end there is a section of wide and very steep firebreak, with a clay and bare rock surface that is extremely slippery when wet.</td>

<br /><br />
The ascent starts gently but soon becomes steep - after the initial section the slope averages around 20% right up to the top.
<br /><br />
This can be a quick track to descend, but watch out for other users on the blind corners. Judging by the shoe prints, this is a popular track with horse riders.</td>

        <td>Description</td>
        <td>This track is a firebreak along the rolling ridge between Wainuiomata and Moores Valley.  Like many firebreaks, it rigorously follows the ridgeline, making no compromises for the sake of comfort or ease.  Consequently, there are many short, sharp climbs followed immediately by short, often technically challenging, descents.
<br /><br />
At the first major high point there are two things of interest:<br />
•	The first is the spectacular views over the Wainuiomata Valley and, in the distance, Wellington Harbour.<br />
•	The second is another firebreak that drops down a ridge towards Wainuiomata. At the base of the initial extremely steep (45%+) section is a sign that says "Private property. Keep out. No exit".  Continuing along <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/201">Wainui Centre</a>, about 0.25km past the high point, there is an easy shortcut to the base of the other firebreak's extremely steep section.
<br /><br />
There are several more steep up/down sections as the track reaches its highest point, at the summit of Mount Mowlem, and then continues down hill for a while. Just past the summit is a trig, which is a useful landmark.
<br /><br />
Eventually the track just peters out, about 1km beyond the summit of Mount Mowlem, becoming too overgrown to proceed any further (if, in fact, it ever did).</td>

        <td>Getting there</td>
        <td>Branches off <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/81">ECNZ pylon road</a> towards the south, at an intersection that also includes the access road to a prominent communications tower.
<br /><br />
The track is a dead-end, so return the same way. The return journey is slightly easier, since it has more down hill than up hill.</td>

The upper part of the track is more like a fire break.  As you descend, the track gets narrower, ending with a very steep gravel path consisting of several zigzags - which give the track its name.

<br /><br />
The Fraser Street end of the track is clearly marked.  The sign by the street indicates no mountain bikes, but a newer sign just up the path shows that mountain bikes are permitted.</td>

You can proceed up or down the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/81">ECNZ pylon road</a>, which traverses the length of the Eastern Hutt Hills.  <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/75">Labyrinth</a> starts from the top of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/74">Jungle Gym</a>, continuing up the hill more-or-less parallel to the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/81">ECNZ pylon road</a>.

About 40m before the track enters the bush, <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/176">WTP Easy track</a> branches off to the right.  This is also the exit from <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/77">Beeline</a>.

The track used to go through the dirt race track ("The Bowl"), but since December 2008 winds its way through the bush to meet <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/74">Jungle Gym</a> at a T-intersection.</td>

As a purpose designed and built mountain bike track, Labyrinth has a nice flow – especially when descending.  The track is quite narrow in places, and although not technically demanding it is more difficult than <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/74">Jungle Gym</a>.
<br /><br />
About 200m from the top of Labyrinth, you'll reach a short road that provides access to a power pylon.  This used to be the end of Labyrinth.  In mid-2008 the track was extended to reach <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/78">Spoonhill</a> - just continue along the track into the bush directly opposite.</td>

        <td>The track starts at the top of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/75">Labyrinth</a> and ends at the back of the playground on Parkway.  The <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/81">ECNZ pylon road</a> also passes the top of Spoonhill – look out for power pylon 28 which is 30m downhill from the road.
<br /><br />
Much of the track consists of a clay surface that is especially tricky when wet.  Not much of the track has a solid base, so deep ruts are common.
<br /><br />
About 150m down from power pylon 28, the track branches in two directions. Take <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/79">T491</a> to the left for the moderate, all-weather track or continue on Spoonhill to the right for the difficult, dry weather track. The two tracks rejoin about 0.3km further down Spoonhill.</td>

<br /><br />
After exiting the track, return to Waiu Street by turning right on Parkway.  Alternatively, turn left on Parkway and follow the road around to the bottom of the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/76">Konini Firebreak</a>.</td>

        <td>From the carpark at the sub-station follow the 4wd road as it traverses along under a small hill with a transmission tower on it. Ignore the right-hand 4wd track that goes up to the tower. After crossing a few rustic gates you will come to an information board on your left with some local history about the area. There is a small cattle yard here and another gate. From here the track traverses the main hillside heading north. You climb at a gentle gradient for a good kilometre passing under a transmission tower. Just after crossing a sturdy gate with style on the left you will come to what I call <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/32">Skyline</a> proper. You can head north towards Crowsnest and Mt Kaukau, or left up a steep climb towards <a href="/area/show/4">Wrights Hill</a> and <a href="/area/show/1">Makara Peak</a>.</td>

        <td>From the other side of the rusty fence head right and you will see a rough line heading left and down through pine needles. When you come to the small grass clearing turn left and then right once back into the trees. Follow the trail down under the rocky bluff. From here you should be able to follow the trail through the pine needles. When the single track makes a right hand onto an old 4wd track follow it all the way to the gorse exit tunnel. Beware the last step down to the transmission tower. This tower is number 9 on the Wilton-Central Park line. At present the trail follows the 4wd track down and south. When you come to the intersection at the bath-tub with <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/45">Goatesque</a>, turn left to exit back up to the Makara Hill road summit.</td>

Follow the single track until you come to a sharp left-hander that is close to some pine trees. <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/44">Lost World</a> starts at the rusty fence you can just see beyond about 10 metres of gorse.</td>

        <td>This track is still pretty ferral. I couldn't possibly condone illegal track building, but this is really just clearing some old existing logging/transmission routes and a few connector bits. There is a 10 metre gorse-bash section at the top which is rather unpleasant. The main descent is open and only loosely defined. It's easy to get lost or 'gullied' if you decide to choose your own route. Beware if going off-trail as there are heaps of pointy branches around each tree, many hidden under large nests of needles up in the trees. Seriously, I don't think it ever gets windy in there.</td>

        <td>By traversing the ridges from Makara Hill to Mount Kau Kau, this track offers spectacular views both over Wellington and the western hills towards Makara Beach.
<br /><br />
With a combination of farm roads, single track, and open grass areas, there is plenty of variety along this relatively long track.  Recent track building has replaced some sections of farm road with single track - nice.
<br /><br />
When travelling from the south the inclination is generally upwards, plus there are several significant valley/peak combinations to be negotiated, making for a decent bit of climbing overall.

Watch out for a few low hanging trees over the track, though they are easy to avoid.

There are a couple of tracks along the way that head off to the east into Otari-Wilton's Bush - no bikes allowed in there.</td>

At the northern end of the Johnson Hill Reserve look for a wide, grassy track that drops gently down towards the east.

        <td>This track is a great way to get from Karori to <a href="/area/show/4">Wrights Hill</a>, or vice versa.  If heading up hill from the top of Burrows Avenue, you'll leave the suburban streets and immediately be plunged into deep, dark bush that seems like it is a long way from anywhere.
<br /><br />
Much of the track has never seen direct sunlight, so it tends to be a bit damp in places.  The track surface is mostly leaf covered dirt, with some exposed tree roots and chunky rocks for armouring.
<br /><br />
At the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/187">Paparata</a> intersection, almost 0.3km from the top of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/43">Burrows Ave</a>, the natural flow when descending is to continue along <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/187">Paparata</a>.  A hard left turn is required to continue down <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/43">Burrows Ave</a> instead.
<br /><br />
Less than 0.2km from the Burrows Avenue end the track divides into two branches at an unmarked intersection.  The upper branch is <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/183">Lynmouth</a>, while the lower branch is <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/43">Burrows Ave</a>.
<br /><br />
The map also shows a short alternative route, which is steep and narrow. It is unmarked at both ends, but the main track is obvious so there shouldn't be too much confusion.</td>

        <td>Getting there</td>
        <td>The bottom of this track is on what looks like a private driveway off the top of Burrows Avenue. There are official track signs and an information board, so no worries about access.
<br /><br />
The top branches off <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/182">Landsdowne</a> 0.2km from the Wrights Hill lower carpark.

        <td>Technically challenging rumble down a deep, dark valley.
<br /><br />
The track follows a creek, crossing it several times.  During or after wet weather, the distinction between the track and creek becomes somewhat unclear in places, adding to the fun/torture (depending on one's point of view).
<br /><br />
At the top of the track is a sign warning about the "dappled lighting conditions". Just along from the warning sign, on the righthand side of the track, is a headless Jesus statue.
<br /><br />
The dappled lighting conditions are the least of your problems as you soon encounter a steep boulder strewn rock garden that has only a passing resemblence to a track. If this is too intimidating, then proceed no further.  There are numerous other obstacles as you drop down the valley, including sudden drops, rocks in awkward places, and lots of slippery tree roots across the track.
<br /><br />
For those still keen, ascending <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/29">Salvation</a> and descending <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/30">Deliverance</a> makes for a great circuit.</td>

There is a sign post for Skyline (<a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/29">Salvation</a>) and <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/43">Burrows Ave</a>. Follow <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/29">Salvation</a> for about 30 metres and you will come to a large sign for <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/30">Deliverance</a> which dives off to the left just before <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/29">Salvation</a> ascends slightly.</td>

The easiest entry to find is Normal, which is described above. Another popular entry is <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/52">Mr X</a>. For a more challenging start try the entry known as <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/69">Downpipe</a>, from which <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/70">Evil</a> makes a hard left-hand turn away from the natural flow of the track just before the section known as Pure Evil.

        <td>From George Denton Park go through the metal gate and follow the track up. Very soon you will meet the bird sanctuary fence. You can follow the fence in either direction, however heading up (left) from here is the most popular way to go.
<br /><br />
The 4wd track continues up in short steep rises up to the wind turbine. From here the gradient is generally more rolling until you reach the highest point, also known as the tapu sign. The views east from here are excellent.
<br /><br />
After a short descent you will pass a gap in the regular fence on your left - this is the last exit if you wish to go up towards <a href="/area/show/2">Hawkins Hill</a>. From here the track traverses for about 300 metres before diving down to the glade. Beware of this descent if wet as the gradient increases going down culminating in a rutty clay section before levelling off again.
<br /><br />
From the glade you can access <a href="/area/show/4">Wrights Hill</a>. To continue around the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/25">Fenceline</a> keep the fence on your right and head up. The track climbs for about 500 metres before levelling off again. Just past a transmission tower there is an intersection on your left that will take you to the <a href="/area/show/4">Wrights Hill</a> parade ground.
<br /><br /><a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/25">Fenceline</a> continues for another 0.6km before it meets the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/31">Scout Hall</a> track. You can go down the steep hill beside the fence but it is extremely steep with loose gravel and rocks, beware. It is easier to go down <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/31">Scout Hall</a> and then rejoin <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/25">Fenceline</a> at the bottom - possibly via <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/174">Croydon</a>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Getting there</td>
        <td>There are many places to access this track. The most popular would be via the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/28">Roller Coaster</a> from George Denton Park at the end of Highbury Road in Highbury.
<br /><br />
Another popular access is from the Parade Ground at the top of <a href="/area/show/4">Wrights Hill</a>. From the sealed access road, go around the metal pole gate on to a gravel 4wd road. Take the next right over another metal pole gate. After about 500m you will come to a large grassy area, this is the Parade Ground. Head east towards the wind turbine, and when you meet the predator-proof fence turn right.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Other notes</td>
        <td>This track is popular with walkers/runners and their dogs. Also after a good storm the fence is checked by the bird sanctuary people, so watch out for vehicles. I have also met horses, trail bikers and the odd stray livestock on this track.</td>

At the <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/43">Burrows Ave</a> intersection, the natural flow when descending <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/43">Burrows Ave</a> is to continue along <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/187">Paparata</a>.

        <td>Description</td>
        <td>As you leave the road end you are immediately plunged into the bush and confronted with probably the tightest switch-back on the entire track. After this things settle down as the track winds through the bush over various small wooden bridges and corners. The first intersection to <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/189">Woodhouse</a> is on a sharpish right-hand switch-back. It is clearly marked with a large sign that says "no bikes".
<br /><br />
After this the track levels off for about 700 metres. Continue climbing. There are a couple of brief downhill bits but it's pretty much up hill all the way to the next intersection to <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/43">Burrows Ave</a>. Continuing straight on the track climbs for only another 250 metres before levelling off. The last 500 metres is level and then slightly down. As you sweep around a downhill bend out of the bush past the turn-off to <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/30">Deliverance</a>, the top carpark straight ahead about 30 metres on.</td>

        <td>Getting there</td>
        <td>The top can be reached from the first carpark on <a href="/area/show/4">Wrights Hill</a>, which is on your right coming up Wrights Hill road just where the gradient levels off on a sharp left-hand bend. The bottom can be reached from the end of Fitzgerald Place, it is the most obvious trail on the north side of the parking area. The less obvious track is the exit to <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/30">Deliverance</a>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Other notes</td>
        <td>This track has been designed with decreasing radius corners (from downhill pov) which is an attempt to reduce the speed of riders coming down. This makes for a 'power climb' as you can accellerate out of the corners.<br /><br />This track was originally (officially) called Skyline and is a part of the 'Skyline Trail'. But a lot of people including me think this name is really confusing (other <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/32">Skyline</a>) so the unofficial name <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/29">Salvation</a> is used here, as it is used informally by local riders.</td>

        <td>This is a neat piece of singletrack through a pleasant bush setting. While it isn't technical, some of the switchbacks can be a little tricky - especially when climbing in the wet. 
<br /><br />
Combine this track with <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/34">S Bend</a> and <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/25">Fenceline</a> to form a complete circuit of the Karori Wildlife Sanctuary.
<br /><br />
In a couple of places there are detours, where the track briefly splits into alternative paths - one slightly easier than the other.  These detours are only a few metres long.

Alternatively, follow <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/25">Fenceline</a> to just below the summit of Wrights Hill.  At the point where <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/25">Fenceline</a> dives down an extremely steep section, this track branches off into the bush.
<br /><br />
The bottom of the track is at the southeastern corner of the scout hall.</td>

<br /><br />
In an open part of <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/184">Lower Car Park</a>, this track branches off from an unmarked intersection at an acute angle back up the hill. The map also shows a short alternative connection from <a href="http://tracks.org.nz/track/show/184">Lower Car Park</a>, which is steeper but at least it has a sign.
<br /><br />
The zig-zag section from the upper car park is paved, though it has several unpaved shortcuts through the bushes.

<br /><br />
The track is fairly steep, gaining around 60m in altitude in short order, but the surface mostly provides good grip so the climb isn't too difficult.
<br /><br />
From the bottom there are two alternative entries - one with lots of steps, and the other has no steps but it does have an excessively tight switchback. There are still some steps just above the alternative entry, but only a few.</td>
